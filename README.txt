Welcome! It's with great pleasure that I present github with my first python game. It consists on a kitchen set with objects falling from the sky. 
 In this game you have to move the objects with your keyboard arrows in order for them to fall in the table. Its a fun arcade game that you can spend triyng to reach a new highscore and complete levels. This game has a new level for each set of scores.

TO run this code you have to open the cmd on a paste with all this files and run "python gameV3.py"

If you cant run its probably because you probably have a module missing on your computer for example "pygame" or "numpy". You also need of corse "python" installed
